# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with **React**, showcasing my projects, skills, and professional journey as I transition into software development.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to design, build, and maintain a modern front-end application while applying best practices in component architecture, state management, and UI composition.

## 🤖 Use of AI Tools

This project was built using my **own React knowledge**, with **AI-assisted support** for:

- Logic validation and edge-case handling
- UI/UX copy improvements
- Learning reinforcement and best practices

AI was used as a **learning accelerator and productivity tool**, not as a replacement for understanding or implementation.
